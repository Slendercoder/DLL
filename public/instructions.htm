      This game is played by two human players (you and a remote partner).
      <br><br>
      <p>When the game starts, in your main view you will see two jars with different types of objects. One jar will have more objects than the other.</p>
      Your task is to set up pairs of objects. A pair of <em>the same</em> type adds <b>1</b> point to your score; a pair of <em>different</em> types adds <b>5</b> points.

      <br><br>
      The goal is to score as many points as you can.

      <br><br>
      If you click on the button "Talk to partner", a box with two buttons, labeled with meaningless words (strings of random characters), will pop up. You can choose which word to send.

      <br><br>
      If your partner sends a message in your direction, a box displaying the message will pop up in your main view. Then, you can choose between sending them an object of some of your jars, or ignoring the message.

      <br><br>
      The game is repeated a certain number of rounds.
      <br><br>
