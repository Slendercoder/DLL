      This game is played by two human players (you and a remote partner).
      <br><br>
      <p>When the game starts, in your main view you will see two jars with different types of objects. One jar will have more objects than the other.</p>
      Your task is to set up pairs of objects. A pair of <em>the same</em> type adds <b>1</b> point to your score; a pair of <em>different</em> types adds <b>5</b> points.
      If you click on the button "Talk to", a box with two buttons, labeled with meaningless words (strings of random characters), will pop up. You can choose which of them to send.
      In turn, if your partner sends you a message, a box displaying the message will pop up in your main view. You can choose between sending them an object of some of your jars, or ignoring them.
      The goal is to score as many points as you can.
            <br><br>
      The game is repeated a certain number of rounds.
